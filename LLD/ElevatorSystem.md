# Elevator System - Low-Level Design

## 1. Requirements Analysis
### Functional Requirements
- The system should allow passengers to request an elevator to a specific floor.
- The system should efficiently manage multiple elevator requests.
- The system should move elevators to the requested floors.
- The system should stop at the requested floors.
- The system should open and close doors at each floor.
- The system should display the current floor of each elevator.
- The system should handle emergency situations.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** The system should respond to elevator requests quickly (e.g., within 5 seconds).
- **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a large number of elevator requests and elevators.
- **Reliability:** The system should be reliable and fault-tolerant.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- The building has a fixed number of floors.
- Each elevator has a maximum capacity.
- The system has access to a power supply.

## 2. High-Level Architecture
### System Components
- Elevator Controller: Manages the movement of elevators.
- Elevator Car: The physical elevator that transports passengers.
- Floor Panel: Allows passengers to request elevators.
- Display: Shows the current floor and direction of elevators.

### Core Entities
- Elevator: Represents an individual elevator car.
- Request: Represents a passenger's request to go to a specific floor.
- Floor: Represents a floor in the building.

### Component Interactions
- The Floor Panel sends a Request to the Elevator Controller.
- The Elevator Controller assigns the Request to an Elevator.
- The Elevator moves to the requested Floor.
- The Elevator notifies the Display of its current Floor and direction.

## 3. Class Design

### UML Class Diagram
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class ElevatorController {
        +void addElevator(Elevator elevator)
        +void requestElevator(int floor)
        +void step()
    }
    class Elevator {
        +int currentFloor
        +Direction direction
        +void moveToFloor(int floor)
        +void openDoors()
        +void closeDoors()
    }
    class FloorPanel {
        +void requestFloor(int floor)
    }
    class Display {
        +void showFloor(int floor)
        +void showDirection(Direction direction)
    }
    enum Direction {
        UP,
        DOWN,
        IDLE
    }
    ElevatorController -- Elevator : manages
    Elevator -- Display : has
    FloorPanel -- ElevatorController : requests
```

### Interface Definitions
```java
interface ElevatorControlSystem {
    void requestElevator(int floor);
    void addElevator(Elevator elevator);
}
```

### Core Classes
```java
class ElevatorController implements ElevatorControlSystem {
    // Implementation details
}

class Elevator {
    // Implementation details
}
```

## 4. Design Patterns Used
- **Strategy Pattern**: Used for selecting the next elevator to service a request. The strategy can be based on factors like distance, direction, and load.
- **Observer Pattern**: Used to notify displays when the elevator's state changes (e.g., current floor, direction).
